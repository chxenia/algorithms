# Swift Algorithms from "Grokking Algorithms" Book

This repository contains Swift implementations of various algorithms introduced in the book "Grokking Algorithms" by Aditya Bhargava. These algorithms cover a wide range of topics, from basic sorting and searching algorithms to more advanced data structures and algorithms.

## Table of Contents


- [Selection Sort](./SelectionSort.swift): An implementation of the selection sort algorithm for sorting an array.

(Add more algorithms to the table of contents as you add them to the repository.)

## Getting Started

Feel free to explore the code and use it as a reference for learning and implementing algorithms in Swift. You can find the Swift code for each algorithm in the respective files.

## Usage

You can clone this repository to your local machine and run the Swift code examples to understand how the algorithms work. For example, to run the Selection Sort code, you can execute the following command:
