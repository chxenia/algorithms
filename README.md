# Swift Algorithms from "Grokking Algorithms" Book

This repository contains Swift implementations of various algorithms introduced in the book ["Grokking Algorithms" by Aditya Bhargava](https://github.com/egonSchiele/grokking_algorithms). These algorithms cover a wide range of topics, from basic sorting and searching algorithms to more advanced data structures and algorithms.

## Table of Contents

- [Binary Search](https://github.com/chxenia/algorithms/tree/main/BinarySearch): An implementation of the binary search algorithm for sorting an array.
- [Selection Sort](https://github.com/chxenia/algorithms/tree/main/SelectionSort): An implementation of the selection sort algorithm for sorting an array.

(Add more algorithms to the table of contents as you add them to the repository.)

## Getting Started

Feel free to explore the code and use it as a reference for learning and implementing algorithms in Swift. You can find the Swift code for each algorithm in the respective files.

## Usage

You can clone this repository to your local machine and run the Swift code examples to understand how the algorithms work
