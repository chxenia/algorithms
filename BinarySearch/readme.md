### Running time (Big O)

For binary search, you have to check log n elements in the worst case. 
- For a list of 8 elements:
`log 8 = 3`, because `2^3 == 8`
So for a list of 8 numbers, you would have to check 3 numbers at most. 
- For a list of 1,024 elements:
`log 1,024 = 10`, because `2^10 = 1,024`
So for a list of 1,024 numbers, youâ€™d
have to check 10 numbers at most.
